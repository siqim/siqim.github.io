- I started cycling in 2025! By June 2025, my FTP reached ~240W. My strava profile is [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/163933972), and [this]({{ '/images/bike.jpg' | relative_url }}) is my road bike!
- I have 5.5k+ followers on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/miao-si-qi), a Quora-like platform in China.
- *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* are the best games ever. *Genshin Impact* is also awesome!
- I'm a big fan of *Lego Technic*. I once combined them with RC cars to build a few cool Lego cars that could drift and climb!
- I built my own PC and home automation system. I also liked to play with Jetson TX2 and Raspberry Pi.
