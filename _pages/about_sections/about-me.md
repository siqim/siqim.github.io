<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Machine Learning program at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)'s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, supervised by [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). Prior to that, I worked at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) Big Data Lab after receiving my master's degree from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). My Chinese given name is 思奇(siqi), pronounced as 思/si/ 奇/tʃiː/. My Chinese surname is 苗(miao), pronounced as 苗/mɪaʊ/. You can also call me Aki.

My current research focuses on <u><strong>AI for science</strong></u>, particularly geometric deep learning applications in high-energy physics, and on <u><strong>agentic AI</strong></u>, where I study how large language models can act as autonomous reasoning and simulation agents and how they can interact with network-structured data.



<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
