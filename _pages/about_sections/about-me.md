<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Machine Learning program at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)'s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm working on machine learning on graphs under the supervision of [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I was a PhD student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in the Department of Computer Science. Prior to that, I worked at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) Big Data Lab for a while after receiving my master's degree from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Currently, I focus on
geometric & graph deep learning, epsecially on interpretable, generalizable, and scalable learning methods to advance scientific discovery.

My Chinese given name is 思奇(siqi), pronounced as 思/si/ 奇/tʃiː/. My Chinese surname is 苗(miao), pronounced as 苗/mɪaʊ/. It's also fine to call me Aki.
